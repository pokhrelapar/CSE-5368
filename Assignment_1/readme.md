### Model Overview:

The neural network model for this assignment is composed of multiple layers of neurons, with several nodes in each layer. The activation (transfer) function for all the nodes will be a sigmoid function.


### Weights:

Your modelâ€™s weights should include biases, which are represented in the first column of your weight matrices.

### Vectorization:

Ensure that your code is fully vectorized using NumPy. You are NOT allowed to use any external libraries or packages, except for NumPy.

### Training:

Implement the model to update weights after processing each sample (i.e., using a batch size of 1).

### Function Constraints:

You MUST NOT change the name of the primary function (multi_layer_nn) or its parameters. However, you are allowed to add any additional (helper) functions as needed. All helper functions must be included in the same file as the multi_layer_nn() function.

### Running Tests:

To run the tests, use the following command:

py.test --verbose Assignment_01_tests.py
