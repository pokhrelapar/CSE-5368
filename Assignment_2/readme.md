## Multi-Layer Neural Network with PyTorch

The goal of this assignment is to implement a multi-layer neural network model using PyTorch.

The neural network model in this assignment is a multi-layer of neurons with multiple nodes in each layer.
Your code should be using PyTorch and numpy. DO NOT use any other high-level API, package or library.

DO NOT alter/change the name of the function or the parameters of the function.
You may introduce additional functions (helper functions) as needed. All the helper functions should be put in the same file with multi_layer_nn_torch() function.

You may run these tests using the command:
py.test --verbose Assignment_02_tests.py
